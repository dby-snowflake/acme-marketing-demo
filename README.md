USE SCHEMA MARKETING_ANALYSIS;

CREATE VIEW customer_360_view AS
SELECT 
    -- Lead Information
    sl.lead_id,

### 6. Upload Semantic Model
```sql
USE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE;
USE SCHEMA CONFIG;
PUT file:///path/to/acme_semantic_model.yaml @semantic_models AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE OVERWRITE=TRUE;
```

### 7. Create Intelligence Agent

#### Option A: Complete Marketing Intelligence Agent (Recommended)
```sql
-- Execute the complete setup script:
-- 11_create_marketing_intelligence_agent.sql
```

This creates the **ACME Marketing Intelligence Agent** with:
- 4 tools: Customer data analysis, sentiment analysis, document search, web search
- AI sentiment analysis using SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT()
- Marketing document search service
- Email campaign response analysis
- Industry benchmarking capabilities

#### Option B: Basic Marketing Agent
```sql
USE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE;
USE SCHEMA AGENTS;

CREATE AGENT SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.AGENTS."Sunrun Marketing Agent"
WITH PROFILE='{"display_name": "Sunrun Marketing Agent"}'
    COMMENT='Expert Sunrun marketing analyst with access to comprehensive customer data for lead reactivation, ROAS analysis, and multi-touch attribution insights'
FROM SPECIFICATION $$
{
    "models": { "orchestration": "auto" },
    "instructions": {
        "response": "You are a Sunrun marketing expert with access to comprehensive customer data from Google Ads, Salesforce CRM, and website analytics. You specialize in lead reactivation campaigns, ROAS optimization, and multi-touch attribution analysis. Always query the actual data in the customer_360_view to provide specific insights with real numbers. When analyzing lead reactivation, focus on leads with reactivation_potential = 'High Potential' from the last year who did not have bad cancellation reasons. For ROAS analysis, calculate return on ad spend using contract_value divided by daily_spend. For multi-touch attribution, analyze records where has_multi_touch_attribution = TRUE to show conversion paths.",
        "orchestration": "Always use the SunrunAnalyst tool to query actual customer data. Provide specific numbers and actionable insights based on real data.",
        "sample_questions": [
            { "question": "I want to re-activate old leads. Pull a list of high-potential leads from the last year who didn't convert and didn't have a bad cancellation reason. Prioritize those who were highly engaged on our website." },
            { "question": "For customers who converted last quarter, what other marketing touchpoints did they have? Show me the top conversion paths." },
            { "question": "How is our 'CA_Summer_Promo_2025' campaign performing in terms of Return on Ad Spend?" },
            { "question": "What is our overall marketing ROI across all campaigns?" },

        ]
    },

                "type": "cortex_analyst_text_to_sql",
                "description": "Analyzes Sunrun customer data including leads, campaigns, conversions, and website engagement for marketing insights"
            }
        }
    ],
    "tool_resources": {
        "SunrunAnalyst": {
            "semantic_model_file": "@snowflake_intelligence.config.semantic_models/sunrun_semantic_model.yaml"
        }
    }
}
$$;
```

## Verification
After setup, verify the demo works:

```sql
-- Check data
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN reactivation_potential = 'High Potential' THEN 1 END) as high_potential_leads,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN lead_status = 'Closed-Won' THEN 1 END) as conversions
FROM SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.MARKETING_ANALYSIS.customer_360_view;

-- Expected: 200 total, 58 high-potential, 28 conversions
```

## Demo Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Lead Reactivation
```
I want to re-activate old leads. Pull a list of high-potential leads from the last year who didn't convert and didn't have a bad cancellation reason. Prioritize those who were highly engaged on our website.
```
**Expected**: 58 high-potential leads with breakdown by source

### Scenario 2: Multi-Touch Attribution
```
For customers who converted last quarter, what other marketing touchpoints did they have? Show me the top conversion paths.
```
**Expected**: Analysis of touchpoint combinations for conversions

### Scenario 3: ROAS Analysis
```
How is our 'CA_Summer_Promo_2025' campaign performing in terms of Return on Ad Spend?
```
**Expected**: ROAS of 4.6 with campaign performance metrics

## Final Result
- **Agent Location**: Snowsight â†’ AI & ML â†’ Snowflake Intelligence â†’ "ACME Marketing Agent"
- **Data Foundation**: 200 unified customer records ready for analysis
- **Demo Ready**: All 3 scenarios validated and working

## Key Technical Notes
- Uses `FROM SPECIFICATION` syntax for agent creation (not `AGENT_SPEC` parameter)
- Semantic model uses `tables` with `base_table` structure (not `entities`)
- Campaign IDs are null for organic channels (realistic marketing data)
- Agent properly connects to semantic model and queries actual data
